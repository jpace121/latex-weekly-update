#Weekly Update Template#

I wrote this LaTeX template so I could quickly write nice looking weekly updates
for my research group.

To use, put this directory inside the directory the actual updates
will be held in, then copy the 'daily-update.cls' file and the 'standard.tex'
file into the outer directory. 'standard.tex' shows how the class should
be used.
